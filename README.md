__Custom rules to remove various annoyances with 1Blocker.__

Calm Web is a 1Blocker extension that removes clutter, confusion, and advertisements not typically blocked by 1Blocker or other content blockers.

You can [read my journal entry](http://hi@wells.ee/journal/2020-04-21-1blocker-custom-rules/) for more information about how this works and what it looks like.
